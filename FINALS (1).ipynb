The highest precedence is given to parentheses, followed by exponentiation, multiplication and division, and then addition and subtraction.<br>\n\nHere, the expression 30//40 will be evaluated first, because the // operator has a higher precedence than the - operator. The // operator performs integer division, which means that it divides the left operand by the right operand and then rounds the result down to the nearest integer.<br>\n\nSince 30 divided by 40 is less than 1, the result of 30//40 will be 0.<br>\n\nThen, the expression 60-0 will be evaluated, because the - operator has a lower precedence than the // operator. The result of this expression is 60, since subtracting 0 from a number does not change the value of that number.<br>\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression 60-30//40 is 60.",
